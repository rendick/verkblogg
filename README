verkblogg is a utility for optimizing blogging

Beforehand, you should create a folder with the files public/index.html and public/article.html (you can change the HTML content, but without deleting the text ${articleTitle} and ${main}).

After running verkblogg -n, the user will enter information (title and body text) that will later be sent to the posts file in the format "Title;body text;path". The code will then parse DB of all posts and put the information into index.html and articles/{title}.html, thus creating/updating them.

You can also display a list of all posts using the verkblogg -p command.

What are the advantages of this utility? Firstly, it will simplify the creation of posts, since the utility is responsible for creating/updating folders, HTML files and DBs (Saves time and effort). Secondly, due to the fact that all posts are stored in one file, you can save and move it without any problems. Third, the site can be hosted on static hostings (e.g. Github Pages).
